Collection of template files for use with [`new`](https://github.com/JCoMcL/scripts/blob/master/new).
Any instance of "TEMP" in the file is replaced with the filename.
I like to load up my template files with a bunch of extra code because it's easier to delete it when it's not needed than to hunt down examples when it is.
